## My Coding Practice

The folder contains my coding manuscripts,
focus on the experience of how to code **quickly** and **efficiently**.

### Organization

One should well organize the components, code and data, of the project,
in prior of coding anything.

A better suggestion is separating the data and code.

- The code can use the data by the API, so another data with the same format can be used.
- The data can be used by the other projects.
- The data can formulate its own dataset, in which it is easier to sync and transfer.

### Handy Editor

The first thing of an editor is its power of analysis the code.

- It should provide timely suggestions and basic auto-check functions.
- The structure visualization of the code is essentially important to understand and debug.

### Name Variables

The naming of the variables has been underestimated for a long time.
**I have not figured out how to do that properly.**
