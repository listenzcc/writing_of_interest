## Shallow Opinions

### Where to Put Useful Files

The Onedrive is great.

- Security
- Hands-off sync
- Available for everywhere
- Good speed
- **5Gb is TOO SMALL**

You can put the **SMALL** files in there,
as they can be accessed easily when you are travelling around.

### Better Practice of If Block

There are several kinds of writing styles of **If Block**.

```ps1
# Tight Version
if (Bool) {
  # One good job
} else {
  # Another good job
}

# Loose Version
if (Bool)
{
  # One good job
}
else
{
  # Another good job
}

# Better Version
# It shows where and how to switch, and where to stop
if (Bool) {
  # One good job
}
else {
  # Another good job
}
```

At the current stage, I prefer the **Better** version.
Since it shows where and how to switch, and where to stop **clearly**.
