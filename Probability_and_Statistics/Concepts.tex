\subsection{Law of total probability}

What will come may never be absent in the end.
The difference is only how it will be happening.

Thinking from the \textbf{reason} to the \textbf{result}.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{Theroem: Law of total probability}
    Law of total probability

    For random variables $A$ and $B$, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        P(A) = \sum {P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)}, \forall B_i \in B
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

Thinking \textbf{backwardly}.
If we have already know that $A$ only has one option (noted as $a$), which is also inevitable ($P(A=a) = 1$).

\begin{proposition}
    \label{Proposition: Sum of probability of every options is ONE}
    Sum of probability of every options is ONE

    We have $P(a) = 1$ and $P(a|B_i)=1, \forall B_i \in B$.
    Thus,
    \begin{equation*}
        1 = \sum P(B_i), \forall B_i \in B
    \end{equation*}

    Since $a$ can be independent with choice of $B$, thus the proposition may not affected by the choice of $a$.
\end{proposition}
