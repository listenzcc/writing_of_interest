\subsection{Law of total probability}

It is common practice to compute the sum of total probability of all available options.

Thinking \textbf{forwardly}.
Which means starting from the \textbf{reason} to the \textbf{result}.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{Theroem: Law of total probability}
    Law of total probability

    For random variables $A$ and $B$, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        P(A) = \sum {P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)}, \forall B_i \in B
    \end{equation*}

    It is automatically accepted that all the $B_i$s are all separable, and mutually exclusive with each other, which means
    \begin{align*}
        P(B_i, B_j) & = P(B_i) \cdot P(B_j), i \neq j \\
        P(B_i, B_i) & = P(B_i)
    \end{align*}
    It is a prior rule to be accepted, and we will accept it if not specified.
\end{theorem}

Thinking \textbf{backwardly}.
If we have already known that $A$ only has one option (noted as $a$), which is also inevitable ($P(A=a) = 1$).

\begin{proposition}
    \label{Proposition: Sum of probability of every options is ONE}
    Sum of probability of every options is ONE

    We have $P(a) = 1$ and $P(a|B_i)=1, \forall B_i \in B$.
    Thus,
    \begin{equation*}
        1 = \sum P(B_i), \forall B_i \in B
    \end{equation*}

    Since $a$ can be something that naturally happens regardless of the choice of $B$, the proposition may not affected by the choice of $a$.
    Thus, the total probability of all options of $B$ is $1$.
\end{proposition}
